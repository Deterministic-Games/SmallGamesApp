# Small Games App

## Description
This WPF application serves as a host to several small but fun games.

Currently, the list of games is
- Minesweeper
- Tic Tac Toe
- Connect Four
- Memory

The first game I implemented was Minesweeper, and thus, might be more rough around the edges but it helped me gain a greater understanding of MVVM and working with WPF in general.

When I was done with Minesweeper I moved on to Tic Tac Toe, this time with a powerful tool .NET Community Toolkit. This massively reduced dev time by removing much if not all of the boilerplate code in the viewmodel.

With each game my workflow has improved and each game has been easier and easier to implement as my knowledge of WPF improved aswell.
